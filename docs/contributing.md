# Contributing to junoDB

We welcome contributions to JunoDB from everyone! By contributing to this project, you agree to abide by the Code of Conduct outlined in the code_of_conduct.md file.

## Discussions

Our recommendation is to start a discussion as soon as you have an idea for contributing to JunoDB.
This will help you, other interested contributors & the committers get to common grounds early in time.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How can you help

### Code
Look for Issues that are open on below categories, pick an issue, start a slack discussion on slack channel, once we get to common grounds on the solution approach, open a PR with your implementation.
* Bug Fixes
* Enhancements & Improvements 
* Add a new feature that you see missing

### Documentation
You can also improve our documentation
* readme.md
* docs/*.md
* Any other valuable comment you'd like to add to the code that will simplify other developers' lives.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Contribution Process
### Dev Branch
The dev branch of junodb is where new features are added, bugs are fixed, and improvements are made. We ask that all contributions be made to this branch.

### Forking the Repository
To contribute to junodb, you'll need to fork the repository to your own GitHub account. You can then make changes to your fork's dev branch.

### Creating a Pull Request
Once you have made changes to your forked repository, you can create a pull request to merge your changes into the dev branch of the original repository. Before creating a pull request, ensure that your fork is up-to-date with the original repository's development branch. This can be done by syncing your fork with the original repository using the "git fetch" and "git merge" commands.

### Code Review
All pull requests will be reviewed by our team. We appreciate constructive feedback, and we may ask for changes or further information before merging your pull request.


### Steps

* Get your github account.
* Fork the repo into your account.
* Create an issue branch using the dev branch.
* Make modifications to the code.
* Ensure code coverage by added test cases.
* All commits must have the issue ID & summary. Say "[#10] Update readme.md for junoDB".
* Ensure all your commits are squashed.
* Make a Pull Request to merge your changes to the dev branch.
* If there are code review related changes - ensure those commits are also squashed.
* DO NOT include changes that are not directly related to the issue you are trying to resolve.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

* Write tests.
* Keep your change as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
* [Write a good commit message](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
